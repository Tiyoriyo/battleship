# Battleship Game 🚢💥

Welcome to the Battleship Game project! This game was developed using the Jest testing framework and brings the classic naval warfare game to life in the digital world. This project marked my first foray into building a Battleship game with Jest, and it turned out to be an engaging and educational experience. The primary goal of leveraging Jest was to streamline development, ensuring that all code changes could be rigorously tested, providing confidence in the game's reliability. 🎮

## Project Highlights 🌊🔥

- **Separation of Logic:** An important lesson learned from this project was the necessity of separating the game's logic from the user interface and DOM manipulation. In past projects, I often combined these two elements, leading to complex and hard-to-maintain code. By keeping the game's logic and presentation separate, this project became more organized and easier to enhance. 🧠

- **Test-Driven Development:** With a strong focus on writing tests alongside the game's logic, I ensured its accuracy and reliability. The tests acted as a safety net, allowing me to make changes and improvements with confidence, knowing that any issues or regressions would be quickly identified. 🧪

- **AI Development (Future Enhancement):** While working on this project, I considered implementing a smarter AI that could strategically track and destroy ships. However, due to the desire to progress in my learning journey, I deferred this enhancement for future work. A future version of the game may feature a more intelligent AI that hunts down ships systematically. 🤖

- **Real-Time Ship Placement (Future Enhancement):** Another feature that I had contemplated was real-time ship placement. Instead of relying on random ship placement by the logic, I envisioned adding a feature that would display a real-time mouse hover effect, allowing players to visualize their ship positions before committing. This feature remains on the table for future improvements when my web development skills have advanced further. 🛠️

## Conclusion ⚓🎉

In summary, this project was a fantastic learning experience and an enjoyable endeavor. It showcased the advantages of adopting a test-driven development approach with the Jest testing framework when creating a Battleship game. While there are exciting prospects for future enhancements, this version offers a solid foundation for a game of naval strategy. Dive into the code and join the battle with your own Battleship game! ⛵💣
